# CRNY Enrollment Data Tableau Dashboard

The CRNY enrollment data provides insightful information about the demographic, geographic, and financial aspects of local artists in New York. Our Tableau dashboard sheds light on the fascinating intersection where artists' creativity intersects with financial realities.

## Overview

The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of the financial stability across various disciplines of art, regions, and more. One of the key highlights is the creation of a specialized Stability Index, enabling a comparison of financial stability among different fields. This index is calculated by assigning numeric values to stability categories (Very Unstable, Unstable, Fluctuating, Stable, Very Stable), averaging these values across the total population.

## Features

- **Stability Index:** A specialized index showcasing the financial stability of different art disciplines.
- **Household Incomes:** Important data presented through Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards throughout the dashboard.
- **Interactive Analysis:** Multiple action filters enable interactive analysis based on attributes like region, county, and discipline.
- **Valid Business Insights:** Detailed analysis facilitates stakeholders in arriving at valid business standpoints.
